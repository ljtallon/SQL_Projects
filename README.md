## Takeaways
- Privately Insured patients are concentrated in Division 4, while Uninsured and Government-Insured patients are more prevalent in Division 1.
- RPT fluctuates monthly, with Privately Insured patients contributing the most to revenue.
- Pulling the patient's most recent insurance status (via census month) more accurately prevents skewed results.

## Next Steps
- Share insights with healthcare administrators or data science teams for further validation.
- Analyze RPT by patient demographics (e.g., age, treatment duration).
- Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests) to confirm if RPT differences between insurance types are statistically significant.

This project involved advanced SQL data engineering and analytical skills through a complete workflow for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a global energy consumption dataset.

## Project Overview

This SQL script automated backup creation, data quality checks, column reduction, and EDA to uncover global trends in energy usage, fossil fuel reliance, and renewable adoption across countries.
- **Tools:** Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 
- **Techniques:** Data Backup and validation, NULL value handling, deduplication, aggregation and aomparative Analysis (GDP, Population, Energy), year-over-year trend analysis, ranking
- **My Role:** Designed SQL workflow to prepare raw energy consumption data for business intelligence by performing data cleaning, schema management, and analysis logic.

## Key Contributions
- Ensured data preservation with a full backup table for version control and rollback capability.
- Identified columns with 80–90% null values and safely dropped non-informative attributes to optimize query performance.
- Used pattern matching to eliminate aggregated and regional data (ie. "OECD", "Africa", "Other income") for cleaner country-level analysis.
- Performed EDA: Ranked top 10 energy-consuming countries globally, compared GDP and population against average energy use, analyzed fossil fuel vs. renewable energy trends over time, highlighted top countries with the fastest energy growth and lowest carbon share.
- Verified schema consistency, null distribution, and proper data types.

- **My Role:** Developed and executed a complete SQL-based data cleaning workflow, from data import and staging through normalization, validation, and schema optimization.

## Key Contributions
- Used window functions and CTEs to identify duplicate records and implemented a robust deletion strategy to retain unique entries.
- Cleaned company names and standardized industry categories (ie. normalizing “Crypto” variations).
- Trimmed inconsistent whitespace and punctuation in country names.
- Converted date fields from text to a proper SQL DATE type for time-series analysis.
- Identified missing data and used self-joins to populate industries for companies appearing in multiple rows.
- Removed rows with irrecoverable NULLs in key columns like total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off.
- Dropped intermediate columns (row_num) and finalized a clean, analysis-ready dataset (layoffs_staging2).
